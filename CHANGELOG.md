## [0.3.5] - 2025-09-24

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Polish

-   **Changed**: Replaced the "Generate Commit Message" text button in the Source Control panel with the Lollms icon for a cleaner UI.
-   **Improved**: Enhanced the system prompt for git commit message generation with stricter instructions to ensure more reliable and correctly formatted output, especially from smaller language models.

## [0.3.4] - 2025-09-24

### ‚ú® Features

-   **Added**: An **Execute** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) now appears on shell script code blocks (`bash`, `shell`, `sh`, `powershell`, `cmd`, `bat`) in the chat, allowing for direct execution.
-   **Added**: The script runner now supports PowerShell and Windows Batch/CMD scripts.
-   **Added**: The AI Agent can now use a `set_launch_entrypoint` action to programmatically set the main executable file in the project's `.vscode/launch.json`.
-   **Added**: The AI Agent can now use the `auto_select_context_files` action to intelligently select and add relevant files to its own context based on a sub-objective.

## [0.3.3] - 2025-09-24

### ‚ú® Features

-   **Added**: A new **Execute Project** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) has been added to the chat input area, allowing users to run the project using the active VS Code launch configuration.

-   **Improved**: The "Auto-Select Context Files" command now seamlessly transitions into a new chat discussion, sending the user's objective to the AI with the newly selected files already in context.

-   **Improved**: The sidebar view order has been reorganized to **Discussions**, **AI Context Files**, and then **Prompts**.

-   **Improved**: Discussion title generation is now more robust, instructing the AI to return a JSON object to prevent it from answering the prompt directly.

## [0.3.0] - Agent Mode

### ‚ú® Features

-   **Introduced Agent Mode**: A powerful new mode where the AI can create and execute multi-step plans to achieve complex objectives.
-   **Execution Plan View**: The agent's plan is displayed dynamically in the chat, showing the status of each task (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Failed).
-   **Autonomous Self-Correction**: The agent can now analyze failures, revise its plan, and retry tasks without user intervention.
-   **User Intervention**: If the agent fails to self-correct, it will pause and ask the user for guidance (Stop, Continue, or View Log).

### ‚ú® Features

-   **Git Integration**: Added the ability to generate conventional commit messages based on staged or unstaged changes directly from the Source Control panel.
