Lollms-vs-coder is an AI-powered Visual Studio Code extension leveraging a Lollms-compatible API for advanced code assistance, inline autocompletion, context management, and automated git commit message generation.

---

## Features

- **Conversational AI Chat:** An integrated chat panel for coding assistance and debugging, with full discussion history management.
- **AI-Powered Code Actions:** Select code and apply AI actions like "Refactor", "Explain", or "Find Bugs" directly from the editor.
- **Inline Autocomplete:** Get single-line, "ghost text" code suggestions as you type (optional) or trigger them manually with a status bar button.
- **Smart Context Management:** A sidebar file tree lets you control which files are included in the AI's context for more accurate and relevant responses.
- **Customizable Prompts:** Comes with a set of useful, protected default prompts and allows you to create, edit, and organize your own.
- **Git Integration:** Auto-generate conventional git commit messages based on your staged changes.
- **Configurable:** Easily configure the API host, key, and model from the settings UI.
