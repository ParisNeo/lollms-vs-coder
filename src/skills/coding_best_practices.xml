# Professional Coding Standards

## The Clean Code Manifesto
- **Meaningful Names**: Variables and functions should reveal intent without comments.
- **Functions**: Small, single-purpose, and limited arguments (prefer < 3).
- **Comments**: Code should be self-documenting. Use comments only to explain the "why", not the "how".

## SOLID Principles
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle.
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (Open for extension, closed for modification).
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle.
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle.
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (Depend on abstractions, not concretions).

## Design Patterns & Mantras
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself (Abstract common logic).
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid.
- **YAGNI**: You Ain't Gonna Need It (Avoid premature abstraction).
- **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave the code cleaner than you found it.

## Testing & Quality
1. **TDD (Test Driven Development)**: Red -> Green -> Refactor cycle.
2. **Unit vs Integration**: Unit tests isolate logic; Integration tests verify parts work together.
3. **Refactoring**: Regularly improve internal structure without changing external behavior.
4. **Code Reviews**: Look for readability, edge cases, and architectural alignment.
